# API4AI general objects detection sample

This directory contains a minimalistic sample that sends requests to the API4AI General Object Detection API. The sample is implemented in `python` using [aiohttp](https://pypi.org/project/aiohttp/) module.


## Overview

This ready-to-use API offers high-accuracy detection of different types of objects framing them with bounding boxes and predicting their class.


## Getting started

Preinstall dependencies before use:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Try sample with default args:

```bash
python3 sample.py
```

Try sample with your local image:

```bash
python3 sample.py image.jpg
```
